This script eases sending lines to the ahead-started daemon. I needed and tested it for creating a test server with netcat and send the pre-recorded sentences to the clients:

:V4dStart nc -l -p 10010

Starts netcat listening on port 10010. Then you start a client somewhere.
From the buffer you are working:

[Select by v,V,ctrl-v] :V4dSendLine
[Select by v] :V4dSendWord

Sends the line(s) you are on/selected to the daemon (and pushed to clients in my case).

:V4dStop

(-:njoy!
